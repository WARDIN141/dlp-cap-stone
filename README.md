# dlp-cap-stone
Through this project i aim to provide a basic understanding of regex processes work ,how datasets can be segregated on the basis of it and how it can be used inisde a data loss prevention system to provide an alert if sensitive data is found ,i also aim to add a mechanism that works coherently with this so when it detects any sensitive data it will kill any further function as well as add a logging functionality which sends out detailed logs with timestamps , my end goal with this project is to create an autonomous command line program that is able to do everything mentioned above under one roof inside one system.
